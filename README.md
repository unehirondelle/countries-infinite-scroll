2. Clone the project
3. From the root directory type `npm i` to install all the dependencies from package.json
4. Type `npm start` to activate the application
5. Once done the Expo window with the Metro Bundler should be automatically opened. If no - go to http://localhost:19000/
6. To load the application on Android you'll need the **Expo Go** app installed. Or type ``a`` once ``npm start`` is done.
